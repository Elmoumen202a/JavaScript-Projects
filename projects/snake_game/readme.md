# 🐍 Snake Game 🎮

Welcome to the **Snake Game**! This project is a modern version of the classic Snake game, built using **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **JavaScript**. It is simple: navigate the snake, eat the food, and grow longer without crashing into walls or yourself.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎮 **Control the Snake**: Use arrow keys to guide the snake.
- 🍏 **Food Tracker**: See how many food items you've eaten.
- 🏆 **Win/Lose Tracker**: Count how many times you've won or lost.
- ⏩ **Speed Increase**: As the game progresses, the snake gets faster!
- 🎨 **Simple & Clean Design**: Minimalistic style to keep focus on gameplay.

## 📂 Project Structure

- `index.html`: The webpage that displays the game.
- `style.css`: The styling to make the game look sharp and responsive.
- `script.js`: All the game logic, including snake movement, food generation, scorekeeping, and win/lose conditions.

## 🎮 How to Play

1. **Open** `index.html` in any web browser.
2. **Control the Snake** with:
   - ⬆️ Up: `ArrowUp`
   - ⬇️ Down: `ArrowDown`
   - ⬅️ Left: `ArrowLeft`
   - ➡️ Right: `ArrowRight`
3. **Objective**: Eat as much food (🍏) as possible and grow longer.
4. **Don't Crash**: If you hit the wall or your own body, the game resets.

## ⚙️ Game Mechanics

- 🟩 **Snake**: Moves on a grid, and grows each time it eats food.
- 🍏 **Food**: Spawns randomly on the canvas.
- 📈 **Score**: Track how many food items the snake eats.
- ❌ **Game Over**: If the snake hits a wall or itself, it’s game over!
- 🔄 **Restart**: The game automatically restarts after a loss.
