# To-Do List Application

This is a simple to-do list web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Overview

The project consists of three main files:

- **index.html**: This is the main HTML file that contains the structure of the web page. It includes an input field to add tasks, a button to add tasks to the list, and a list to display the tasks.
- **style.css**: This file contains the styles for the HTML elements, defining the layout, colors, and other visual aspects of the page.
- **script.js**: This JavaScript file contains the logic for adding tasks to the list and marking them as completed when clicked.

## Usage

To use the application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. Enter a task in the input field and click the "Add Task" button to add it to the list.
4. Click on a task in the list to mark it as completed. Click again to unmark it.
