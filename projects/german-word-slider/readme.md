# German Word Slider

This project is a simple slider that displays German words and their definitions. It's built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Files

- `index.html`: Contains the basic HTML structure and elements for the slider.
- `style.css`: Contains the CSS styles for the slider.
- `script.js`: Contains the JavaScript code to make the slider functional.
- `README.md`: Provides an overview of the project.

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
2. Use the arrow buttons to navigate through the words and their definitions.

## How It Works

- The words and their definitions are stored in an array in `script.js`.
- The `showSlide` function updates the displayed word and definition based on the current index.
- The `nextSlide` and `prevSlide` functions update the index to show the next or previous word in the array.
- The slider automatically shows the first word when the page loads.
